## CSCI 411: Advanced Algorithms - Final Project
Implementing Bcrypt in CPP (Modified to use standard base64, instead of modified base64)

To compile run
```sh
make bcrypt
make test
```

The Bcrypt algorithm is implemented in bcrypt.cpp, bcrypt.h, main.cpp, test.cpp

The other files are open source libraries
I found two helpful libraries that implement parts of the algorithm

https://github.com/ddokkaebi/Blowfish
implements blowfish in cpp.
 
https://github.com/ReneNyffenegger/cpp-base64/blob/master/base64.cpp
implements base64 in cpp.
